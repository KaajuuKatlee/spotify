    <nav>When it comes to hobbies and extracurriculars, I was literally "Aflatoon" from the movie CHILLAR PARTY as a kid. Growing up, I was involved in a wide range of activities—dancing, singing, badminton, swimming, horse riding, taekwondo, drawing, arts and crafts, public speaking, creative writing and literally many more. The images attached below are not even enough. I was always eager to explore new things, embodying the saying, "Jack of all trades, master of none." However, the pandemic brought an abrupt halt to my pookie-wookie-giggly-wiggly lifestyle, isolating me from the world. And then, the rigors of preparing for the JEE took over. But those hobbies still remain a cherished part of who I am, even if they’ve taken a backseat for now.</nav>
